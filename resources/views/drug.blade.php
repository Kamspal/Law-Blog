                                            When you are dealing with federal drug charges, you are experiencing a completely different world than you would with simple possession. Federal investigators and prosecutors are extreme and have the time, money, and ability to investigate the evidence against you – and they will use it all. You are not going to get off because someone doesn’t show up to court or evidence was lost. These people are organized, experienced, and they want to give you the worst possible punishments.

                                            No matter what, they are not on your side. You will want to hire a federal criminal defense lawyer who has experience in drug cases, going to court, settling out of court, and actually showing up for their clients.

                                            Some lawyers will suggest only settling out of court because that way you “get a better deal.” This isn’t necessarily the case, especially if there are other, more high profile cases that take precedence over yours. It is critical that you call a lawyer that you can trust – which means they get to know you and your case.

Penalties can range from five to 40 years in prison, and, in the most extreme cases, up to $30 million in fines. Often, the highest penalties are reserved for extremely large amounts of PCP, methamphetamines, heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, and prescription drugs.

                                            Federal drug trafficking charges are hard to fight, but they are not impossible. With the right lawyer, you may be able to prove that you weren’t aware the drugs were in your possession, you weren’t going to sell them, you were transporting them under duress, or any other reason why you should not be charged with drug trafficking.

                                            You may also want to talk to a lawyer who has experience in long-term federal investigations relating to drug trafficking, including international drug rings. It is critical for your future to have the right lawyer, or you may never be able to live a normal life again.

You deserve to give yourself, your loved ones, your family, your friends, and anyone else in your life the chance to live life fully and openly – do not sit back and take what is coming your way.
